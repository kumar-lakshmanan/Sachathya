Translates to:
�O you rich in offerings, sing to Mitra, sing to Aryaman, a reverential hymn produced in the sacrificialchamber;
sing a propitiating address to Varuna; sing a hymn of praise to the kings.�

Also Hermann Grassmann (German) writes in his dictionary of the Rig Veda (Leipzig 1873) about Sachathya
