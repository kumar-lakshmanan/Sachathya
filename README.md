Name adopted from the book Rig Veda (translation and commentary) by H. H. Wilson

You can check the Sanskrit verse:
pra mitraya praryam?e sacathyam ?tavaso | varuthya? varu?e chandya? vaca? stotra? rajasu gayata |

Translates to:
“O you rich in offerings, sing to Mitra, sing to Aryaman, a reverential hymn produced in the sacrificialchamber;
sing a propitiating address to Varuna; sing a hymn of praise to the kings.”

Also Hermann Grassmann (German) writes in his dictionary of the Rig Veda (Leipzig 1873) about Sachathya
